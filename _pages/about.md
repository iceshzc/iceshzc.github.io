# 🧑‍🏫 About Me
I am now an algorithmic engineer at <a href="https://www.jdt.com.cn/"> JD Technology</a>. Before that, I participated in a half-a-year-long rotation training in the same company as a Doctor Management Trainee.

I received my Ph.D. from <a href="http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/">Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen</a> in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/yeyunming?lang=en">Yunming Ye</a>. My research areas are graph neural networks, knowledge graphs, spatio-temporal data mining and large language model and mainly focus on urban knowledge graph, question answering and knowledge reasoning.
