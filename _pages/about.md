# 😀 About Me
I am now an algorithm engineer at JD.com, Inc. Before that, I participated in a half-a-year-long rotation training in the same company as a Doctor Management Trainee (DMT).

I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/">Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen</a> in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/yeyunming?lang=en">Yunming Ye</a>. My research areas are knowledge graphs, LLMs and AI Agent, mainly focus on intent recognition, question answering and knowledge reasoning.

>  <span>**I am always open to collaborating with remote students and researchers who are interested in knowledge graphs, LLMs and AI Agent, etc. Please feel free to contact me.**</span> 
```zhichao [at] cshzc [dot] top
```

> <span style="color:red">New!!</span> We're looking for talented full-time employees and interns to join our team working on ```training Vision-Language Models``` and applying it to AI Agent. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.
